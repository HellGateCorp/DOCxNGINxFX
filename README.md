# DOCxNGINxFX

I wrote this to give somethink back to the great and powerful open source community all out there that shares their knowledge or frameworks and from whom I have learned so much. The main function of the Tool is to read various file types of documents and to record and categorize the number of word entries contained in them, to exclude double-set words or to search specifically for word entries in the document. In addition, it is possible to create a specially compiled word list (e.g. for brute force) or to expand an existing one with manual word entries and switch between one of three Themes (soft/girlie/neon). If necessary, the entries can be adjusted in their output case (upper/lower case) or even entire entry categories to be displayed as output. The tool measures the processing time and informs you acoustically about the successful completion of the process. It's lightning fast with the No Duplicate Entries option, with an Intel i5 2.3 GHz CPU core and a test document with over a million entries (the Bible has more than 732000 word entries!!!) the program only needs 50 more seconds to read this. Finally, the vocabulary list you compiled individually can be saved on the hard drive as a text file (*.txt, *.md) or as an “encrypted” binary file (*.bin) that cannot be read by humans. Maybe it could be helpful for Journalists, Tutors, Students, Crackers or all the other Nerds out there. So feel free to cantact me to share your user experience or may some bugs into. Thank you.
