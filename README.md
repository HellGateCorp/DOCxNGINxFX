# WORDLISTxGENERATORxFX

A JavaFX based Wordlist-Generator Application that I made for another Project. It allows you to produce a Wordlist and save it on your Volume as a BIN-File 0️⃣1️⃣1️⃣0️⃣1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣

Now you can take any .txt, .md, or .rtf file from your local space to create a fully word-by-word delimited word list that you can use for brute force attacks, for example. I'm working on more features that will be available soon.
